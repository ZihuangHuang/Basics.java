Doing this exercise in IntelliJ
IntelliJ should detect the build.gradle file and
automatically set up the project for you, but this may take a
bit of time.
You should now be able to run Basics.java and its associated unit tests in BasicsTest.java . Open
Basics.java and make the changes needed in order for all of the tests to pass.
Submission instructions
After finishing this exercise, you should submit only the Basics.java file to MarkUs. Here, you will be able to run
the self-tests provided to verify that your code is working in the submission.
